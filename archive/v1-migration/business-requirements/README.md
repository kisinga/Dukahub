# V1 Business Requirements & Original Vision

## Project Origin & Business Context

### Initial Business Problem

**Dukahub** was conceived as a **comprehensive inventory and sales management system** for small to medium-sized retail businesses in developing markets.

### Original Business Model

Based on the financial and inventory logs from **July 2024**, the system was designed to address:

1. **Manual Inventory Tracking**: Paper-based or basic spreadsheet inventory management
2. **Sales Recording**: Inconsistent sales data capture and reporting
3. **Financial Tracking**: Limited visibility into daily financial performance
4. **Multi-location Management**: Need for centralized management across multiple stores
5. **Customer Management**: Basic customer relationship and credit tracking

## Core Business Requirements (July 2024)

### 1. Inventory Management

- **Product Catalog**: Centralized product database with photos and descriptions
- **Stock Tracking**: Real-time inventory levels and low-stock alerts
- **Multi-store Support**: Inventory management across multiple locations
- **Photo Integration**: Visual product identification and cataloging

### 2. Point of Sale (POS) System

- **Sales Recording**: Real-time transaction capture
- **Payment Processing**: Cash, credit, and mixed payment methods
- **Receipt Generation**: Automated receipt creation and printing
- **Customer Database**: Customer profiles with purchase history

### 3. Financial Management

- **Daily Sales Reports**: End-of-day sales summaries
- **Expense Tracking**: Business expense categorization and reporting
- **Profit & Loss**: Automated P&L calculations and reporting
- **Cash Flow Management**: Daily cash position tracking

### 4. Business Intelligence

- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visual performance indicators and trends
- **Sales Analytics**: Product performance and sales patterns
- **Customer Insights**: Purchase behavior and customer segmentation
- **Inventory Analytics**: Stock turnover and optimization recommendations

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### 1. Multi-tenancy Strategy

**Company-based Isolation**: Each business operates as a separate "company" with:

- Isolated product catalogs
- Separate customer databases
- Independent financial tracking
- Role-based access control (users vs admins)

### 2. Machine Learning Integration

**Computer Vision for Inventory**:

- **Product Recognition**: Camera-based product identification
- **Automated Cataloging**: ML-powered product categorization
- **Visual Search**: Image-based product lookup
- **Quality Control**: Automated product image validation

### 3. Technology Stack Selection

- **Backend**: PocketBase (Go + SQLite) for rapid development
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS + Alpine.js for lightweight reactivity
- **ML**: TensorFlow.js for client-side model inference
- **UI**: Bootstrap for responsive design

## Original Financial Model (July 2024 Data)

### Daily Sales Patterns

- **Average Daily Sales**: ~$3,500-5,500 range
- **Peak Days**: Friday-Saturday performance spikes
- **Product Mix**: Mixed inventory across categories
- **Payment Methods**: 60% cash, 40% credit

### Inventory Turnover

- **Fast-moving Items**: Daily replenishment requirements
- **Slow-moving Items**: Monthly review and optimization
- **Seasonal Variations**: Quarterly inventory adjustments
- **Supplier Management**: Multi-supplier coordination

## User Roles & Permissions

### 1. Admin Users (Super Admins)

- **Multi-company Oversight**: Manage multiple business entities
- **System Configuration**: Global settings and preferences
- **Analytics Access**: Cross-company reporting and insights
- **User Management**: Admin user creation and permissions

### 2. Company Users (Regular Users)
