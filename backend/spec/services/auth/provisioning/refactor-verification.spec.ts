/**
 * Refactor Verification Spec
 *
 * This test suite verifies that provisioning services maintain correct behavior
 * while using Vendure services (the "front door") rather than direct repository access.
 *
 * **Purpose**:
 * - Initially asserts current behavior (may include repository usage)
 * - Will be updated to assert "service-based" behavior after refactoring
 * - Ensures no regression during migration to Vendure-First principles
 *
 * **Usage**:
 * - Run these tests before refactoring to establish baseline
 * - Update tests after refactoring to verify service usage
 * - Use provisioning harness to verify service calls
