No one buys a porsche because they need to get from point a-b
No one buys a rolex because they need to know the time
No one buys a macbook because they need a computer

Posche sells performance
Rolex sells status
apple sells creativity

The product is just a vehicle for an emotion.
What feeling do I want to evoke in my customers?

Remember:
Businesses compete on prices. Brands compete on value. Experience. Emotion.
