## üìù Documentation Philosophy

We believe in preserving our thought process and decision-making history. This documentation includes:

- **Current Implementation**: How the system works today
- **Historical Context**: Why we made specific technical decisions
- **Future Plans**: What we're building next
- **Migration Path**: How we evolved from V1 to V2

By maintaining comprehensive documentation, we can learn from our past and make better decisions for the future.
