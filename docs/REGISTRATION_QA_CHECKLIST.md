# Registration Flow QA Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive QA checklist for testing the registration and login flows, covering all edge cases and validation scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure:
- [ ] Backend server is running
- [ ] Redis is available and connected
- [ ] Default channel has shipping and tax zones configured
- [ ] Payment handlers (cash-payment, mpesa-payment) are registered in vendure-config.ts
- [ ] Database is clean or existing test data is noted

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Successful Registration Flow

**Test Case:** Complete successful registration with all valid inputs

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to signup page
2. Enter valid company information (company name, code, currency)
3. Enter valid admin information (first name, last name, phone, optional email)
4. Enter valid store information (store name, optional address)
5. Request OTP
6. Enter correct OTP
7. Complete registration

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Registration data stored in Redis temporarily
- [ ] OTP sent successfully
- [ ] Channel created with correct code and token

- [ ] Role properly linked to channel (visible in Vendure admin UI)
- [ ] User created with phone number as identifier
- [ ] Administrator created and linked to user
- [ ] User's authorizationStatus set to PENDING
- [ ] All audit logs created (channel, stock location, payment methods, role, user, admin)
- [ ] User redirected to login page with success message

**Verification:**
- [ ] Check database: Channel exists with correct code
- [ ] Check database: Stock location exists and linked to channel

### 7. Partial Failure Recovery

**Test Case:** Transaction rollback on channel creation failure

2. Attempt registration

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Transaction rolls back
- [ ] No partial entities created (no orphaned stock locations, payment methods, roles, users)
- [ ] Error message with REGISTRATION_ prefix for easy debugging

**Test Case:** Transaction rollback on stock location creation failure

**Steps:**
1. Mock stock location creation to fail

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Transaction rolls back
- [ ] Channel creation also rolled back
- [ ] No partial state

**Test Case:** Transaction rollback on role creation failure

**Steps:**
1. Mock role creation to fail
2. Attempt registration

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Transaction rolls back
- [ ] Channel, stock location, payment methods rolled back
- [ ] No partial state

### 8. Idempotency

**Test Case:** Registration retry after partial failure

**Steps:**
1. Start registration
2. Cause transaction to fail mid-way
3. Retry registration with same phone number and company code

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] If user was created but provisioning incomplete: Error "Account already exists"
- [ ] If channel was created but provisioning incomplete: Error "Channel code already exists"
- [ ] Manual repair required by ops (documented in error messages)

**Test Case:** Multiple registration attempts with same data

## Edge Cases Summary

The following edge cases are explicitly handled and should be tested:

1. ✅ **Partial Failure Recovery**: Transaction rollback ensures no orphaned entities
2. ✅ **Idempotency**: Duplicate checks prevent re-registration with same phone/company code
3. ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: User and channel uniqueness validated before creation
4. ✅ **Role Assignment**: Role-channel-user linkages verified after creation
5. ✅ **Context Issues**: Uses RequestContext.empty() for privileged operations, falls back to repository if needed
6. ✅ **User permissions on newly created role**: Full permission set verified
7. ✅ **Channel token uniqueness validation**: Checked before creation
8. ✅ **Stock location assignment validation**: Verified after assignment
9. ✅ **Payment method handler existence check**: Errors caught and clearly reported
10. ✅ **Zone validation (shipping/tax zones)**: Validated with clear error messages
11. ✅ **Currency code validation**: Validated against CurrencyCode enum
12. ✅ **Phone number format consistency**: Normalized at start, used consistently
13. ✅ **Duplicate registration prevention**: User and channel checks in place
14. ✅ **Transaction rollback on partial failure**: All operations wrapped in transaction
15. ✅ **Audit logging completeness**: All entity creations logged

## Manual Testing Instructions

### Setup Test Environment

```bash
# Ensure backend is running
npm run start:dev

# Ensure Redis is available
redis-cli ping

# Check default channel has zones
# Navigate to Vendure admin UI → Settings → Channels → Default Channel
# Verify defaultShippingZone and defaultTaxZone are set
```

### Test Registration Flow

1. Open signup page
2. Fill out registration form
3. Request OTP
4. Verify OTP (check console for OTP in development)
5. Complete registration
6. Verify user cannot login (PENDING status)
7. Manually approve user in database: `UPDATE user SET customFields = jsonb_set(customFields, '{authorizationStatus}', '"APPROVED"') WHERE identifier = '0712345678';`
8. Verify user can login after approval

### Database Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check channel creation
SELECT id, code, token FROM channel WHERE code = 'test-company';

-- Check stock location assignment
SELECT sl.id, sl.name, c.id as channel_id
FROM stock_location sl
JOIN channel_stock_locations csl ON sl.id = csl.stock_location_id
JOIN channel c ON c.id = csl.channel_id
WHERE c.code = 'test-company';

-- Check payment methods assignment
SELECT pm.id, pm.code, pm.handler_code
FROM payment_method pm
JOIN channel_payment_methods cpm ON pm.id = cpm.payment_method_id
JOIN channel c ON c.id = cpm.channel_id
WHERE c.code = 'test-company';

-- Check role creation and permissions
SELECT r.id, r.code, r.description, array_length(r.permissions, 1) as permission_count
FROM role r
WHERE r.code = 'test-company-admin';

-- Check role-channel linkage
SELECT r.id, r.code, c.id as channel_id, c.code as channel_code
FROM role r
JOIN role_channels rc ON r.id = rc.role_id
JOIN channel c ON c.id = rc.channel_id
WHERE r.code = 'test-company-admin';

-- Check user creation
SELECT u.id, u.identifier, u.custom_fields->>'authorizationStatus' as status
FROM "user" u
WHERE u.identifier = '0712345678';

-- Check user-role linkage
SELECT u.id, u.identifier, r.code as role_code
FROM "user" u
JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id
JOIN role r ON r.id = ur.role_id
WHERE u.identifier = '0712345678';

-- Check administrator creation
SELECT a.id, a."emailAddress", a."firstName", a."lastName", u.id as user_id
FROM administrator a
JOIN "user" u ON a."userId" = u.id
WHERE u.identifier = '0712345678';
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Full Idempotency**: If a transaction fails after user creation but before all provisioning completes, manual repair is required. The duplicate checks will prevent re-registration, but the partial state must be cleaned up manually.

2. **Chart of Accounts**: Ledger account initialization for new channels is not yet implemented. This must be handled separately or via migration.

3. **RoleService Fallback**: If RoleService.create() fails due to permission issues, the code falls back to repository-based creation. Both paths are functional, but RoleService is preferred for integration with Vendure's role management system.
