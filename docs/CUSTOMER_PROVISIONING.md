## Customer Provisioning Checklist

**Complete ALL steps for each new customer. Missing any step will break order creation.**

### Required Information

Before starting, collect:

- **Company Name:** (e.g., "Downtown Groceries")
- **Company Code:** Lowercase, no spaces (e.g., "downtown-groceries")
- **Admin Contact:** Name, email, phone
- **Currency:** Default currency for the region
- **Store Location:** Physical address for the main store

- [ ] **Step 2:** Create Stock Location
- [ ] **Step 3:** Create Payment Methods
- [ ] **Step 4:** Initialize Chart of Accounts (Ledger)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Channel

**Purpose:** Creates the customer's isolated environment

1. Navigate to **Settings → Channels**
2. Click **"Create new channel"**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name:** `{Company Name}` (e.g., "Downtown Groceries")
   - **Code/Token:** `{company-code}` (e.g., "downtown-groceries")
   - **Currency:** Select appropriate currency
4. Click **Save**
5. **Important:** Copy the Channel ID for reference

**Why this matters:** Each customer needs their own channel for data isolation.

### Step 2: Create Stock Location

**Purpose:** Required for inventory tracking and order creation

1. Navigate to **Settings → Stock Locations**
2. Click **"Create new stock location"**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name:** `{Company Name} - Main Store`
   - **Description:** `Primary store location for {Company Name}`
4. **Assign Channel:** Select the channel from Step 1
5. Click **Save**

**Why this matters:** Orders CANNOT be created without a stock location. This is a Vendure requirement.

### Step 3: Create Payment Methods

**Purpose:** Enables checkout functionality in the POS system

#### 3a. Create Cash Payment

1. Navigate to **Settings → Payment Methods**
2. Click **"Create new payment method"**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name:** `Cash Payment`
   - **Code:** (auto-generated)
   - **Handler:** Select `cash-payment` from dropdown
   - **Enabled:** ✅ Yes
   - **Channels:** Select the channel from Step 1
4. Click **Save**

#### 3b. Create M-Pesa Payment

1. Click **"Create new payment method"** again
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Name:** `M-Pesa Payment`
   - **Code:** (auto-generated)
   - **Handler:** Select `mpesa-payment` from dropdown
   - **Enabled:** ✅ Yes
   - **Channels:** Select the channel from Step 1
3. Click **Save**

**Why this matters:** No payment methods = no checkout options in POS.

### Step 4: Initialize Chart of Accounts (Ledger)

**Purpose:** Required for all financial transactions. The ledger is the single source of truth for all financial data.

**IMPORTANT:** This step must be completed before any financial operations (sales, purchases, payments) can occur.

#### 4a. Automated Setup (Recommended)

If your system has automatic CoA initialization, it should run when a channel is created. Verify accounts exist:

1. Connect to the database
2. Run verification query:
   ```sql
   SELECT code, name, type 
   FROM ledger_account 
   WHERE "channelId" = {channelId}
   ORDER BY type, code;
   ```
3. Ensure all required accounts exist (see list below)

#### 4b. Manual Setup (If Not Automated)

If accounts are not automatically created, you must manually insert them:

```sql
-- Replace {channelId} with the actual channel ID from Step 1

-- Assets
INSERT INTO ledger_account ("channelId", code, name, type, "isActive") VALUES
  ({channelId}, 'CASH_ON_HAND', 'Cash on Hand', 'asset', true),
  ({channelId}, 'BANK_MAIN', 'Bank - Main', 'asset', true),
  ({channelId}, 'CLEARING_MPESA', 'Clearing - M-Pesa', 'asset', true),
  ({channelId}, 'CLEARING_CREDIT', 'Clearing - Customer Credit', 'asset', true),
  ({channelId}, 'CLEARING_GENERIC', 'Clearing - Generic', 'asset', true)
ON CONFLICT ("channelId", code) DO NOTHING;

-- Income
INSERT INTO ledger_account ("channelId", code, name, type, "isActive") VALUES
  ({channelId}, 'SALES', 'Sales Revenue', 'income', true),
  ({channelId}, 'SALES_RETURNS', 'Sales Returns', 'income', true)
ON CONFLICT ("channelId", code) DO NOTHING;

-- Assets (continued - AR is an asset)
INSERT INTO ledger_account ("channelId", code, name, type, "isActive") VALUES
  ({channelId}, 'ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE', 'Accounts Receivable', 'asset', true)
ON CONFLICT ("channelId", code) DO NOTHING;

-- Liabilities
INSERT INTO ledger_account ("channelId", code, name, type, "isActive") VALUES
  ({channelId}, 'ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE', 'Accounts Payable', 'liability', true),
  ({channelId}, 'TAX_PAYABLE', 'Taxes Payable', 'liability', true)
ON CONFLICT ("channelId", code) DO NOTHING;

-- Expenses
INSERT INTO ledger_account ("channelId", code, name, type, "isActive") VALUES
  ({channelId}, 'PURCHASES', 'Inventory Purchases', 'expense', true),
  ({channelId}, 'EXPENSES', 'General Expenses', 'expense', true),
  ({channelId}, 'PROCESSOR_FEES', 'Payment Processor Fees', 'expense', true),
  ({channelId}, 'CASH_SHORT_OVER', 'Cash Short/Over', 'expense', true)
ON CONFLICT ("channelId", code) DO NOTHING;
```

#### Required Accounts Checklist

Verify these accounts exist for the channel:

**Assets:**
- [ ] `CASH_ON_HAND` - Cash on Hand
- [ ] `BANK_MAIN` - Bank - Main
- [ ] `CLEARING_MPESA` - Clearing - M-Pesa
- [ ] `CLEARING_CREDIT` - Clearing - Customer Credit
- [ ] `CLEARING_GENERIC` - Clearing - Generic

**Income:**
- [ ] `SALES` - Sales Revenue
- [ ] `SALES_RETURNS` - Sales Returns

**Assets (continued):**
- [ ] `ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE` - Customer credit balances (asset - money owed to us)

**Liabilities:**
- [ ] `ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE` - Supplier credit balances (liability - money we owe)
- [ ] `TAX_PAYABLE` - Taxes Payable

**Expenses:**
- [ ] `PURCHASES` - Inventory purchases
- [ ] `EXPENSES` - General expenses
- [ ] `PROCESSOR_FEES` - Payment Processor Fees
- [ ] `CASH_SHORT_OVER` - Cash Short/Over

**Why this matters:** Without these accounts, financial operations will fail with "Missing accounts" errors. The ledger is the single source of truth for all financial data, and all transactions must post to these accounts.

### Step 5: Create Admin Role

**Purpose:** Defines permissions for the customer's admin user

1. Navigate to **Settings → Roles**
2. Click **"Create new role"**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name:** `{Company Name} Admin`
   - **Description:** `Full admin access for {Company Name}`
   - **Channels:** Select the channel from Step 1
4. **Set Permissions:** Select ALL for these entities:
   - **Asset:** CreateAsset, ReadAsset, UpdateAsset, DeleteAsset
   - **Catalog:** CreateCatalog, ReadCatalog, UpdateCatalog, DeleteCatalog
   - **Customer:** CreateCustomer, ReadCustomer, UpdateCustomer, DeleteCustomer
   - **Order:** CreateOrder, ReadOrder, UpdateOrder, DeleteOrder
   - **Product:** CreateProduct, ReadProduct, UpdateProduct, DeleteProduct
   - **ProductVariant:** CreateProductVariant, ReadProductVariant, UpdateProductVariant, DeleteProductVariant
   - **StockLocation:** CreateStockLocation, ReadStockLocation, UpdateStockLocation
   - **Payment:** CreatePayment, ReadPayment, UpdatePayment, SettlePayment
   - **Fulfillment:** CreateFulfillment, ReadFulfillment, UpdateFulfillment
5. Click **Save**

**Why this matters:** Missing permissions cause 403 errors in the frontend.

### Step 6: Create Admin User

**Purpose:** Creates the customer's login credentials

1. Navigate to **Settings → Administrators**
2. Click **"Create new administrator"**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Email:** `admin@{company-domain}.com`
   - **First name:** `{Admin First Name}`
   - **Last name:** `{Admin Last Name}`
   - **Password:** Generate strong password (save securely)
4. **Assign Role:** Select the role from Step 5
5. Click **Save**
6. **IMPORTANT:** Send credentials to customer securely

**Why this matters:** This is the customer's only way to access their system.

**Solution:**

1. Go to Settings → Roles
2. Edit the customer's role
3. Add CreateAsset, ReadAsset, UpdateAsset permissions
4. Save changes

#### Orders Fail to Create

**Cause:** No stock location assigned to channel  
**Solution:**

1. Go to Settings → Stock Locations
2. Edit the stock location
3. Ensure it's assigned to the customer's channel

#### No Payment Methods at Checkout

**Cause:** Payment methods not assigned to channel  
**Solution:**

1. Go to Settings → Payment Methods
2. Edit each payment method
3. Ensure the customer's channel is selected

#### Financial Operations Fail with "Missing accounts" Error

**Cause:** Chart of Accounts not initialized for channel  
**Solution:**

1. Verify channel ID from Step 1
2. Run the SQL verification query from Step 4a
3. If accounts are missing, run the manual setup SQL from Step 4b
4. Verify all 14 required accounts exist
5. Retry the financial operation

#### Customer Balance or Supplier Balance Shows Zero/Incorrect

**Cause:** Ledger accounts not properly initialized or transactions not posting  
**Solution:**

1. Verify ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE accounts exist
2. Check that financial transactions are posting to ledger
3. Verify period locks are not blocking entries
4. Review ledger_journal_entry table for posted transactions

#### Admin Sees All Companies

**Cause:** Role not scoped to channel  
**Solution:**

1. Go to Settings → Roles
2. Edit the customer's role
3. Ensure only their channel is selected

#### User Cannot Login

**Cause:** User not assigned to role or role not assigned to channel  
**Solution:**

**Cause:** Missing customer or address information  
**Solution:** Ensure customer and addresses are set before state transition

### ML Model Issues

#### Product Recognition Not Working

**Cause:** ML model not uploaded or configured  
**Solution:** Upload ML model files to channel assets (see [VENDURE.md](./VENDURE.md))
