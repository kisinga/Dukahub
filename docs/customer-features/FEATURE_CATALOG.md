## How to Use This Catalog

- **Merchants & Managers** – Use this as a **capability map** when evaluating Dukarun or onboarding new staff.
- **Operations / Implementers** – Use the links to focused guides to configure each area step by step.
- **Product & Marketing** – Reuse the language here in pitch decks, landing pages and onboarding emails; it is aligned with the underlying implementation.

If you are unsure where a feature fits, start from the **focused guide that matches the business problem** (e.g. “We need to sell on credit” → [Analytics & Ledger](./analytics-and-ledger.md), “We want trial + subscription” → [Orders & Billing](./orders-and-billing.md)).
