## Analytics, Credit & Ledger

This guide explains Dukahub’s **financial backbone** – how it tracks money, balances, and credit – in business language.

---

## What Problems This Solves

- Ensure **sales, purchases and payments** are recorded correctly without double entry in spreadsheets.
- Maintain accurate **customer and supplier balances**.
- Support **sell-on-credit** flows without losing control.
- Provide a clear foundation for **analytics and reporting**.

---

## Key Capabilities (with Origins)

- **Double-entry ledger per business** – Every financial operation posts balanced entries to a ledger scoped to a single business (channel).  
  **Origin:** Dukahub-Exclusive (see `LEDGER_ARCHITECTURE.md`).

- **Channel-specific chart of accounts** – Each business has its own accounts for cash, M‑Pesa, sales, purchases, AR, AP, etc.  
  **Origin:** Dukahub-Exclusive (see `CUSTOMER_PROVISIONING.md`).

- **Customer & supplier balances from ledger** – Customer and supplier balances are computed from ledger entries, not ad-hoc calculations.  
  **Origin:** Dukahub-Exclusive.

- **Credit approvals and limits** – Credit policies (who may buy on credit, up to how much) are enforced using credit flags and limits.  
  **Origin:** Dukahub-Exclusive (credit plugin + custom fields).

- **High-level dashboards & KPIs** – The dashboard presents key numbers (sales, inventory indicators) driven by backend services.  
  **Origin:** Dukahub-Enhanced (frontend dashboards backed by ledger-aware services).

## Double-Entry Ledger (Per Business)

### 1. Single Source of Truth

Per `LEDGER_ARCHITECTURE.md`, Dukahub treats the ledger as the **only** source of financial truth:

- Every financial action – sales, payments, purchases, adjustments – creates ledger entries.
- Each entry is **double-entry**:
  - Debits = Credits.
  - All entries are linked to a **channel** and usually a **customer or supplier**.

This ensures:

- Strong auditability.
- Reliable balances.
- A clean path to integrating with full accounting systems.

**Origin:** Dukahub-Exclusive.

---

### 2. Chart of Accounts per Channel

Each channel (business) has its own **chart of accounts**, including:

- Assets:
  - `CASH_ON_HAND`
  - `BANK_MAIN`
  - `CLEARING_MPESA`
  - `ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE` (customers who owe you)
- Liabilities:
  - `ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE` (suppliers you owe)
  - `TAX_PAYABLE`
- Income:
  - `SALES`
  - `SALES_RETURNS`
- Expenses:
  - `PURCHASES`
  - `PROCESSOR_FEES`
  - `CASH_SHORT_OVER`

During onboarding (see `CUSTOMER_PROVISIONING.md`), these accounts are created per channel, either automatically or via SQL scripts.

---

## Customer & Supplier Balances

### 1. How Balances Are Computed

In the ledger:

- **Customer balances** (Accounts Receivable) are computed from:
  - All entries in the `ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE` account for a given customer.
- **Supplier balances** (Accounts Payable) are computed from:
  - All entries in the `ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE` account for a given supplier.

The `outstandingAmount` custom field on the customer record is a **view** of this ledger data, not a standalone number.

**Interpretation:**

- For customers:
  - Negative outstanding amount: customer owes you money.
- For suppliers:
  - Positive outstanding amount: you owe the supplier money.

**Origin:** Dukahub-Exclusive ledger integration.

---

### 2. Why This Matters

Compared to spreadsheets or “total minus payments” in app logic:

- **No drift:** If you see a balance, it’s always reconcilable back to journal entries.
- **Safer automation:** Bulk adjustments, payments and refunds update the ledger, not random counters.
- **Easier auditing:** Your accountant can export journal entries and rebuild balances externally if needed.

---

## Credit Management

### 1. Credit Flags & Limits

Credit-related fields on the customer record (see `CUSTOMER_SUPPLIER_INTEGRATION.md` and `VENDURE_CUSTOM_FIELDS.md`):

- `isCreditApproved` – Boolean flag; only approved customers can buy on credit.
- `creditLimit` – Maximum allowed credit in base currency units.
- `outstandingAmount` – Current running balance from the ledger.

Available headroom is:

```text
availableCredit = creditLimit - abs(outstandingAmount)
```

The POS uses this to decide whether a **credit sale** is allowed at checkout.

**Origin:** Dukahub-Exclusive (credit plugin + ledger-aware validation).

---

### 2. Credit Checkout Behaviour

From a cashier’s point of view:

- If a customer is not credit-approved, or their headroom is insufficient:
  - The **credit payment option** will not be available (or will be blocked).
- If the customer is approved and has enough headroom:
  - The cashier can select “Pay on Credit”.
  - The ledger posts an entry increasing `ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE`.

From a finance point of view:

- All credit sales and repayments are traceable in the ledger.
- Adjusting credit limits and approvals is a controlled operation requiring specific permissions.

---

## Reporting & Dashboards

### 1. Operational Dashboards

The Dukahub dashboard (see `frontend/ARCHITECTURE.md`) surfaces operational KPIs such as:

- Total sales over a period.
- Stock summary.
- Low-stock alerts.
- Customer and supplier overviews.

These are fed by:

- Vendure queries for domain objects (products, orders, customers).
- Ledger-aware backend services for balances and summaries.

**Origin:** Dukahub-Enhanced (dashboard UX + ledger-backed services).

---

### 2. Export and Deep Analysis

For deeper analytics:

- You can query:
  - The admin GraphQL API for high-level data.
  - The ledger tables for journal entries (if you operate your own backend).
- Data can be exported to:
  - BI tools (Metabase, Superset, etc.).
  - Accounting tools via CSV or custom integrations.

While Dukahub ships with pragmatic dashboards, it intentionally keeps the underlying data model open for advanced usage.

---

## How to Use & Configure (Workflows)

### A. Onboarding a Channel’s Ledger

**Who:** Dukahub ops or technical implementer.

1. After creating a new channel, ensure the **chart of accounts** is initialised:
   - Use the automated account initialisation if available.
   - Or run the SQL snippets from `CUSTOMER_PROVISIONING.md`.
2. Verify that:
   - Required accounts exist for the channel.
   - No “missing accounts” errors appear when transactions run.

Once set, all future financial operations will use these accounts.

---

### B. Approving a Customer for Credit

**Who:** Finance / back office with appropriate permissions.

1. Open the customer record in the dashboard.
2. In the **Financial / Credit** section:
   - Turn on **Credit Approved**.
   - Set a realistic **Credit Limit**.
3. Save.

From then on:

- The POS checks this flag and limit when attempting a credit sale.
- The ledger ensures that sales and payments are correctly recorded.

---

### C. Reviewing Customer & Supplier Balances

**Who:** Finance, owners.

1. Navigate to **Customers** or **Suppliers** list in the dashboard.
2. Look at the **Outstanding Amount** column:
   - Negative: customer owes you.
   - Positive: you owe supplier.
3. For more detail:
   - Open the individual record for more context.
   - Use external tools (where you have access) to query ledger entries for a deep audit.

---

### D. Reconciling Payments

**Who:** Finance / accounting.

1. For **customer payments**:
   - Record payments in Dukahub (cash, MPesa, etc.).
   - The ledger reduces `ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE` and updates appropriate cash accounts.
2. For **supplier payments**:
   - Record supplier payments via dedicated flows.
   - The ledger reduces `ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE` and updates cash/bank accounts.
3. Reconcile with:
   - External bank statements.
   - Paystack and M‑Pesa reports.

Because all movements go through the ledger, reconciling is a matter of matching journal entries to external statements.

---

## Limitations & Notes

- **Not a full ERP yet:** Dukahub’s ledger is robust but intentionally narrow in scope – it focuses on POS-related transactions and direct integrations.
- **Historical migration:** Moving legacy transaction history into the ledger may require custom migration work and careful reconciliation.
- **Reporting breadth:** Built-in dashboards are intentionally focused; broad BI and multi-entity financial reports are best handled by external tools connected to the underlying data.

---

## Vendure vs Dukahub: What’s What

- **Vendure Core**
  - Provides the base commerce entities (orders, customers, products).
  - Does not ship with a full ledger system.

- **Dukahub-Enhanced**
  - Integrates commerce events with financial posting services.
  - Ensures that core operations (orders, payments) are ledger-aware.

- **Dukahub-Exclusive**
  - The entire double-entry ledger design and implementation.
  - Per-channel chart of accounts and account initialisation.
  - Credit plugin and credit-limited checkout enforcement.
  - Financially-aware dashboards in the Dukahub frontends.
